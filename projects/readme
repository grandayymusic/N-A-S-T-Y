Welcome to the read me of the project folder.

This folder is to place and edit submittions for the next update/project.

This is like a to-do list.

1) Economy - Like Tatsumaki where you can do t!daily (200 credits), t!daily {mention} and check your balance.
So, what I am planning is these features:
//daily (every 24 hours) - Free 250 Credits
//daily {mention} (also every 24 hours) - Gives from 150 - 350 credits to the mentioned user
//bal - Check Bal
//deposit {money in your pocket} - Deposit your money in the bank
//bank - Creates back account and check your bal in the bank

//steal {mention} - Tries to steal money from the mentioned user. The success rate is 50-50. If succeed, the money stealed will be his. If fail, different endings.
Endings:
Call police and you got caught and payed 150 credits to be free
etc

//work {every 12 hours} - Work and get paid instantly

2) Picture cards for profile like Tatsumaki's t!profile
- Name
- Nickname
- Credits
- Bio
- etc

3) Custom Picture like NotSoBot's .wdt {text}/{picture}
- ^

4) Levels for using the bot
- Every command for every minute will get random xp from 10 - 30
- Level up 
- Global Leaderboard (leaderboard for all guilds)

To be added
